### IMPORTANT
For this project we elected to use the rich library for some formatting to make text clearer.

For the library and its functions see: https://github.com/Textualize/rich

The script should install the rich library automatically, however in the event it does not run the following line to install it:

python -m pip install rich

If you do not wish to use the rich library or cannot install it, the text formatting will be weird but should still be readable.

An example of what the text looks like without rich:

### Testing the scripts:
**Step 1:** Run server.py

**Step 2:** Run client.py to get the role of advisee, and then write your question and hit enter

**Step 3:** Run another instance of client.py until you get the advisor role (might take a few tries)

**Step 4:** In your advisor instance of the program, write your answer and hit enter

**Step 5:** As both client and server, write y or n if you want a new role.
